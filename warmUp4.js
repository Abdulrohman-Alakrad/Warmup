// 1-Choose the correct comparison operator to display "true", when: 5 is less than 7.
// 2-Use a conditional operator in which If the variable age is a value below 18 and the variable type is "male", 
//the value of the variable voteable should be "Too young", otherwise the value of voteable should be "Old enough".


1- the operator is (< ): 5 < 7 			----  true 

2-  	if (age < 18 && type = "male"){

		return voteable = "Too young";
	}
	else 
		return voteable = "Old enough "
