// 1- Using recursion Write a JavaScript program to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two positive numbers.

function divisor (num1,num2){
	if (num1 % num2 === 0){
		return num1;
   	}
   	return divisor(num1 , num1% num2);
}

// 2-Write a function called sum that accepts two numbers as parameters, and sum them together but without suming them togther directly
//you can only add one at each summetion, you'll need to use recursion in this.


function sum (num1,num2){
	if()
}
